[GA_type]
# options of the type of Meta-Heuristic strategy to be used

# This option can be used to make the choice between the normal GA and Repair strategy based GA
# normal_GA - This option can be used to run the DSE with normal GA
# dpll_GA - This option can be used to run the DSE with the Repair strategy based approach
# both - This option enables runs with both DSE runs and compares the outputs
# default value for this parameter is 'both'
run_type: both

# This option is used to select between the kind of objectives to run the DSE for
# energy - This option corresponds to a unconstrained run with energy as the single objective
# time - This option corresponds to a unconstrained run with time as the single objective
# unconstrained - This option corresponds to unconstrained DSE run with multiple objectives
# constrained - This option corresponds to energy constrained or time constrained run with multiple objectives.
#default value is 'constrained'
