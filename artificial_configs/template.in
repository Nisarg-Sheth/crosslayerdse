# options of the type of Meta-Heuristic strategy to be used

# This option can be used to make the choice between the normal GA and Repair strategy based GA
# normal_GA - This option can be used to run the DSE with normal GA
# dpll_GA - This option can be used to run the DSE with the Repair strategy based approach
# both - This option enables runs with both DSE runs and compares the outputs
# default value for this parameter is 'both'
run_type: both

# This option is used to decide whether the DSE time of the PB strat should be equated with the time of the Normal GA
# PB strat takes longer for each evaluation than the Normal GA.
# True - Equate the DSE time
# False - Don't equate the DSE time, keep the number of generations same
equate_time: False

# This option is used to select between the kind of objectives to run the DSE for
# energy - This option corresponds to a unconstrained run with energy as the single objective
# time - This option corresponds to a unconstrained run with time as the single objective
# unconstrained - This option corresponds to unconstrained DSE run with multiple objectives
# constrained - This option corresponds to energy constrained or time constrained run with multiple objectives.
# default value is 'constrained'
